# MetaMask Integration testing w/ Puppeteer

Run `npm run e2e:puppeteer` to test dApp + MetaMask integration. Not that Cypress does not and will never support Chrome extension testing.

- Can use Jest instead of Mocha.
- Maybe use this w/ Cypress?
- Or just use Puppeteer for all e2e testing?
  - But not great erogonomics
- Try to run headless with xvfb
